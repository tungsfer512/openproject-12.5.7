# Dropdown menu

> Example: A dropdown menu with four items

The dropdown menu is a contextual menu triggered by clicking on a dropdown button. It provides options to the use.

## Structure and Options

The dropdown menu consists of a list of items, generally *menu rows* and an optional title.

The title is not interactive. It serves to provide additional context, if necessary.

A menu item is interactive and generally represents an action. The menu item can optionally have an icon on the left side.

> Example of an existing more menu that has icons next to each menu row


## States

Each menu item has three states: regular, hover and clicked.

## Margins and Spacing

Each item has a height of 1.5 rem. There is a 0.25 rem spacing between the optional icon and the label, and a 0.5 rem rem spacing to the left and right.

The width is determined by the longest object, or can be defined manually. If defined manually, items that are very long and exceed this length are truncated.
