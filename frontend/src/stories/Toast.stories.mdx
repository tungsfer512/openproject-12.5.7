# Toast

> Example: A success toast 

Toasts are small generally one-line messages that appear to inform the user of the result of an action, or an update to the current view.

## Structure and Options

The toast consists of:

- An optional icon
- A text
- A close button

There are four types of toasts, each with a specific icon and colour associated with it:

An **Information** toast is blue (background: Feedback/Info/Light, stroke: Feedback/Info/Dark) and provides the user with helpful information about the current view. 

> Eg: a blue notification toast (as it exists today)

A **Success** toast is green (background: Feedback/Success/Light, stroke: Feedback/Success/Dark)and indicates to the user that an action has been successfully carried out.

> Eg: a green success toast (as it exists today)

A **Warning** toast is orange (background: Feedback/Warning/Light, stroke: Feedback/Warning/Dark) and indicates that there are potential risks or possibility of error.

> Eg: an orange toast (is this used somewhere?)

An **Error** toast is red (background: Feedback/Error/Light, stroke: Feedback/Error/Dark) and indicates that something did not not go as expected, and that there is a problem.

> Eg: a red toast (as it exists today, when moving an WP in GANTT view is not possible)

##  Behaviour

The toast appears either as result of user action (a work package attribute is modified, for example) or a background action (there are new notifications).

The text is generally merely informational, although there might sometimes be a link with an approproate action.

> Eg. Blue notification toast with "Load new notifications" link.

Toasts generally disappear automatically; they must be manually closed by the user. The only exception is the Success toast, which _can_ disappear automatically, if the user has enabled this in their account settings.

Ideally, only one toast should be visible at any time. Hoever, there are circumstances where multiple toasts might be generated and visible to the user; in this case, the toasts must "pile" vertically with a 1 rem (?) spacing between them.

## Margins and Spacing

The toast has a height of 2.5 rem, with a 0.5 rem padding on all sides, and a 0.5 rem spacing between the icon, text and the close button.
