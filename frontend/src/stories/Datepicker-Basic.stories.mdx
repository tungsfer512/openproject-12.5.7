# Basic Date Picker 

Basic date pickers are attached to existing date input fields and is displayed as a drop-down when that date input field is in focus. It consists of only the mini-calendar component.

Unlike the Work package and Modal variants, the basic date picker does not trap focus and as such does not allow for any keyboard navigation.

## Sub-variants

The structure is very basic and consists only of one mini calendar. There are two sub-variants:

### Single

**Single** allows picking just one date (2023-02-09)

> **Example**: An example of a basic range date picker (with date pre-filled in the attached date input field)

### Range

**Range:** allows inputing a range (2023-02-09 - 2023-02-14), and shows the date picker with two months.

> **Example**: An example of a basic range date picker (with date pre-filled in the attached date input field).

## Mobile

The basic date picker does not have a mobile version. On mobile devices, Flatpickr will automatically gracefully degrade to the device's native date picker.

## Accessibility

The date picker itself never receives focus (and thus does not afford keyboard navigation or screen reader compatibility; see [Date Picker: Common elements](#) for accessibility shortcomings of of Flatpickr). However, the date input field that the date picker is attached to can receive focus, and all users can type in the desired date in the ISO format.
