# Date picker: Common elements

The date picker is a key element in OpenProject and is displayed any time the user has to input a date.

> **Example**: a basic work package date picker (no banners)

The most common places where users will interact with a date picker are:

- Work packages (start and finish dates, milestone date)
- Custom fields (of type date)
- Log time and costs
- Admin settings (specifying individual non-working days)
- Filters

## Types

OpenProject offers three different types of date pickers, depending on where and how they are called.

**Work package date pickers** are drop modals only used for the main *date* field of work packages (but not for custom date fields):

> **Example**: a basic work package date picker (with banners, working days only ON)

**Modal date pickers** are also drop modals but are only used outside the main work package date field and where a basic date picker does not provide enough options.

> **Example**: a modal work package date picker (add non-working day)

**Basic date pickers** are barebones dropdown date pickers that only consist of a mini-calendar (and no additional options or fields) and are attached to date input fields on focus:

> **Example**: a basic date picker (filters)

## External dependencies

All date picker are built on the [Flatpickr javascript library](https://flatpickr.js.org/). The library gives us certain functionality out of the box with a fairly high degree of customisation, but also introduces limits (which will be mentioned below when relevant).

Please read the [Flatpickr documentation](https://flatpickr.js.org/instance-methods-properties-elements/) before using or contributing to date pickers.

## Building blocks

All date pickers are built out of a common set of components. The basic building blocks specific to date pickers are:

- Month-year selector
- Days of the week
- Mini day
- Mini calendar (made of Mini days)
- Banner

Apart from the banner, all other building blocks are provided by Flatpickr and only styled in OpenProject; the design system will only describe how they are styled.

Date pickers also use these other components from our design system: Selector field (switch), Form field, Action bar.

### Month-year selector

**Month-year** selectors allow the user to move forward/backwards in one-month increments.

> **Example**: Month-year selector

We use the basic structure provided by Flatpickr:

- previous button: *Grey 1* text, *Primary* on hover,
- month indicator: Body/Small Regular; *Grey 1* text
    - this becomes drop down selector when clicked
- year: Body/Small Regular; *Grey 1* text
    - this becomes a text box when clicked
- next button: *Grey 1* text, *Primary* on hover

There are two sub-variants:

1.  arrows on both sides (for single date pickers)
2.  without the right arrow: used on the left side of a two-month range calendar
3.  without the left arrow: used on the right side of a two month range calendar

### Days of the week

Days of the week are headers for the mini calendar and list the days of the week in three-letter acronyms (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun).

They are set in Caption/Bold; *Grey 1* text.

> **Example**: Days of the week

### Mini day

The mini day displays individual dates on the mini-calendar, and has a number of different states. Each of these states can be *enabled* (it is active and clickable) or *disabled* (it is inactive and not clickable).

> **Example**: The different states of the mini calendar, labeled.
> 
> Top row: enabled, bottom row: disabled.

Mini days are set in Caption/Regular.

- **Regular** days are the default state and cover the vast majority of cases.
    - Enabled: *Grey 1* text on *White* background.
    	- On Hover: add stroke, 1px, Grey 3 (not-rounded)
    - Disabled: *Grey 3* text on *White* background.
        - Used when certain dates that are restricted by relations.
- **A non-working day** can be a weekend or one that's individually-defined in the admin settings:
    - Enabled: *Grey 1* text on *Grey 6* background
        - Used when the "Working days only" switch is OFF.
		- On Hover: add stroke, 1px, Grey 3 (not-rounded)
    - Disabled: *Grey 3* text on *Grey 6* background.
        - Default state, when the "Working days only" switch is ON.
- **Selected-start, select-end or selected-single** indicate the start and finish dates of a range, or the selected date for a single date.
    - They have 5-pixel rounding on the left for start, right for end and and on all corners for single dates.
    - Enabled: *White* text on *Main/Primary* background
    - Disabled: *Grey 3* text on *Grey 5* background
        - Used when the date is already set and not user-modifiable (eg. automatically scheduled).
- **Selected-mid** indicates working days that are included in a date range:
    - Enabled: *Main/Primary* text on *Main/Light* background
    - Disabled: *Grey 3* text on *Grey 5* background
        - used when the range is already set and not user-modifiable (eg. on a parent work package that is automatically scheduled and the dates are set by its children).
- **Selected-mid-non-spanned** indicates non-working days that are spanned (but not counted) in a date range:
    - Enabled state does not exist (since if a date is selected, it cannot be disabled).
    - Disabled: Main/Primary text on *Grey 6* background
        - Used when the selected range spans non-working days that are not included (Working days only switch is ON).
- **Today** indicates today's date.
    - Enabled: *Grey 1* text on *Indication*/*Current* background.
		- On Hover: add stroke, 1px, Grey 3 (not-rounded)
    - Disabled: *Grey 3* text on *Indication*/*Current* background.
        - Used when today falls on a non-working day and "Working days only" switch is ON.

## Mini calendar

The mini calendar consists of three elements:

- a month-year selector
- a days of the week line
- a 7×5 grid of mini days

> **Example**: Mini calendar showing:
> 
> - Today
> - Weekends
> - Individual non-working days
> - Selected range (spanning non-working days)
> - Disabled date range (limited by relations)

For certain months, there might be an additional (6) or one fewer (5) row, depending on the number of days in that month and the starting day.

For example, a February starting on a Monday will only have lines, and a November starting on a Saturday will have six.

**Note:** Work package range date picker, two mini calendars display two mini calendars side by side; the month-year select of the left one has only a left arrow and the right one has only a right arrow.

## Banner

Work packages often have relations to other work package that can limit how the current work package can be scheduled. Banners in the date picker provide helpful contextual information that allows users to either make more informed decisions and understand limitations and potential consequences to changes they might make.

> **Example**: Desktop and mobile banners for the blue info "Available start date and finish dates are limited by relations" banner.

Banners can either be **information banners** that have a blue background (*Feedback/Info/Light*) and give user information about why certain options might not be available, or they can be **warning banners** that have an orange background (*Feedback/Warning/Light*) and warn users that their actions might have other consequences.

These colours are the same regardless of the theme.

Banners have 0.75 rem left/right padding, 0.5 rem top/bottom padding and 0.5 spacing between these three elements:

- an icon (*Info1*) on the left side, 24×24px
- text (set in *Basic/Grey 1*)
    - The first line is set in *Caption/Bold*
    - The second line is set in *Caption/Regular*
- a "Show relations" button that displays all directly related work packages in a custom GANTT view in a new tab

The mobile or single versions have these particularities:

- hides the icon
- retains only the first line of text, with a shorter text string (specified below)

There are four possible variants:

### Automatically scheduled (information)

This is an information banner that is displayed if the work package is that are automatically scheduled. As such, the user cannot input dates (unless they first switch "Manual scheduling" on). This is typically the case for parent work packages, whose dates are derived from those of the earliest and latest children.

> **Example**: Desktop and mobile banner: automatically scheduled.

Text:

> **Automatically scheduled. Dates are derived from relations.**
> Click on “Show relations” for GANTT overview.

Text (mobile or single versions):

> **Automatically scheduled. Dates derived.**

### Available dates limited by relations

This is an information banner that informs the user that certain dates may not be available for selection (visible on the Mini calendar below) due to existing relations. For example, a work package generally cannot start before the finish date of the preceding one.

> **Example**: Desktop and mobile banner: dates limited by relation.

Text:

> **Available start date and finish dates are limited by relations.**
> Click on “Show relations” for GANTT overview.

Text (mobile or single versions):

> **Available dates limited by relations.**

### Manual scheduling

This is a warning banner reminds the user that manual scheduling has been switched on for this work package, and that any existing relations will therefore for ignored for scheduling purposes. All constraints will be ignored, allowing the user to manually pick any date unconstrained by relations.

Note, however, that manual scheduling does not affect non-working days. If "Working days only" is switched on, non-working days remain unavailable.

> **Example**: Desktop and mobile banner: manual scheduling.

Text:

> **Manual scheduling enabled, all relations ignored.**
> Click on “Show relations” for GANTT overview.

Text (mobile or single versions):

> **Manual scheduling, relations ignored.**

### Dates will affect related work packages

This is a warning banner that informs users that changing the dates of the current work package will affect dates of other related work packages. It might for example push the following work package into the future.

> **Example**: Desktop and mobile banner: date will affect related WPs.

Text:

> **Changing these dates will affect dates of related work packages.**
> Click on “Show relations” for GANTT overview.

Text (mobile or single versions):

> **Changes will affect related work packages**.

## Options bar

The options bar consists of one or both of these selector fields:

- Manual scheduling (switch, default: off)
- Working days only (switch, default: on)

> **Example**: Just the top of the date picker with both these options in their default state.

## Input fields

The input field group set applies only to Work package date pickers and can contain these form fields:

> **Example**: The top part of the date picker with start date, end date and duration.

### Start date

Used to input the start date in ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd). Consists of:

1.  Label ("Start date", on top)
2.  Date input field
3.  Today link (that input's today's date)

### Finish date

Used to input the finish date in ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd). Consists of:

- Label ("Finish date", on top)
- Date input field
- Today link (that input's today's date)

### Duration

- Label ("Duration", on top)
- Duration input field that, on focus, turns into an integer field
    - On blur, the word " days" is added at the end, with proper pluralisation

Optionally, for milestones, there is only a single date field:

### Date

Used to input the date for single date pickers in ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd). Consists of:

- Label ("Date", on top)
- Date input field
- Today link (that input's today's date)

## Date picker variants: structure and options
