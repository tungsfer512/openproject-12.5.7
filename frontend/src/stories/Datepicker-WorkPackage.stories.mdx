# Work Package Date Picker

There are two sub-variants:

- *Range:* This is the most complex variety, with info banners, start and end dates, duration, option switches, and two mini calendars visible.
- *Single:* Only a single date field, option switches, single mini calendar. Used only for milestones.

## Sub-variants 
### Range

**Range** consists of:

- Banner
- Options bar
- Input fields (start, finish and duration)
- Two mini calendars
- Action bar

> **Example**: Work package range date picker with default settings

### Single

**Single** consists of:

- Banner (single version)
- Options bar
- Input fields (single date field)
- One mini calendar
- Action bar

> **Example**: Work package single date picker with default settings

## Mobile

- The date picker, like all modals, is displayed full screen with a translucent grey background
- The mobile version of the banner is displayed for bothÂ *range* and  *single* variants
- For range input fields, *Start date* and *Finish date* are in one line and the Duration is a line by itself underneath.
- The action bar has only action (*Save*); the cancel button is hidden, and is replaced with a close floating close button *outside* at the bottom (centred), as is common to all modals in mobile

### Mobile Range

> **Example**: Mobile version of the work package range date picker

### Mobile Single

> **Example**: Mobile version of the work package single date picker

## Accessibility

The date picker receives focus when it is launched and traps focus until the user either closes the modal (via Enter or Escape). These fields can receive keyboard focus:

- Banner (with the 'Show relations' button)
- Options
- Input fields
- Action bar

The mini-calendar itself does not afford keyboard navigation (see see [Date Picker: Common elements](#) for accessibility shortcomings of of Flatpickr).
