# Using this resource

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to document our design system. You will find defined styles, components and patterns in the relevant sections.

You will not find _all_ elements in Storybook yet. The design system at OpenProject is a work in progress; many parts of the software still use older elements that have not been standardised and defined.

As we work through defining and coumenting each new component, we will find them here.

## Other resources

All of the components described here also exist in our Figma libraries: 

- [Foundation styles](https://www.figma.com/file/vOw6PEVIyzaQOIgf02VZFW/Foundations-Library?node-id=228%3A2)
- [Components](https://www.figma.com/file/XhCsrvs6rePifqbBpKYRWD/Components-Library?node-id=386%3A3606)

_You might find examples of some older elements in the older [Living Style Guide](http://spike.openproject-stage.com:4200/assets/styleguide.html#forms). This will eventually be replaced by Storybook, but this will require time._


## Semantics

When describing components, we use certain words in very particular ways:

### Disabled

_Disabled_ is when no interaction is possible. A disabled element can itself have multiple states: a checkbox can be checked and disabled, a switch can be ON and disabled, a dropdown might have a value but but disabled.

The opposite of disabled is _enabled_. All elements are described in their enabled state unless explicitly mentioned.

### Focused and active

Focus simply refers to when an element has the current object in DOM that has the input focus. In OpenProject, elements that are focused generally have a blue outline. 

The opposite of _in focus_ (or focused) is _not in focus_ (or focused).

_Active_ is a similar state as focused, but not entirely the same. For example, in the date picker, the start date can be "active" (meaning that clicking on a date in the mini-calendar will change the start date) but not in focus (because the mouse has clicked outside of the field).

The opposite of active is _inactive_.

### Checked and on

Checkboxes can be _checked_ (true) or _unchecked_ (false)

Radio options can also be "checked" (as in, in a set of three options, only one can be checked) despite this not being the technically correct word. This isi to to distinguish it from "selected" (which refers to selecting an element or an area with the cursor).

Switches can be _ON_ (true) or _OFF_ (false).

## Browsing through the docs

This Storybook is divided in three sections:

**Styles** include foundational elements like typography, colour, spacing and shadows. All other elements are defined using these base styles.

**Components** are individual elements (like checkboxes, buttons or text fields), each of which has its own states, variants and behaviour.

**Patterns** are larger, recurring UI elements made up of a set of different components. Each component used in a pattern still retains its own specificities (options, variatns), but can also have certiain behaviour at the level of the pattern itself. (For example, an action bar can have two or three buttons, which can either be on the left side or the right side).

## To be added:

- What the left-side menu includes (and does not include)
- How to find linked/dependent elements
