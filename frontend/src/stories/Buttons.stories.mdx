# Buttons

> Example: White more button with right icon, Main Save button, Accent Create button with left icon, danger Delete button with icon, Disabled Save button with left icon

Buttons allow users to perform a specific action related to the present context. Compared to links, these actions tend to carry some weight: confirm an action, save settings, delete something, cancel an action.

Buttons have a number of different options (presence of icons/text), styles (white, main, accent, danger, disabled) and states (regular, hover, clicked) that are described below.

Buttons can be used in toolbars, in action bars, in button sets on pages, at the end of a settings page and in modals. They can also be used in combination with links to give certain actions more prominence than others.

## Behaviour

Buttons react immediately on click. They may submit a form, open a link, save or change state, launch a dropdown or a modal.

## Styles

There are four button styles and a disabled one.

**Basic**

The basic style is grey by default. Use it for secondary actions or in a group of buttons where there are no primary actions (for example, in a toolbar).

> Example: Open in Nextcloud with right icon, Settings with left icon, More with right icon

**Main**

The main style is used to represent the primary action, like Save or Confirm.

> Example: Save with left icon, More with right icon

**Accent**

The accent style allows an action to stand out (considerably) from the normal colour set. It should be used sparingly to draw special attention to an action that the user might otherwise not notice.

> Example: Create button with left and right icon, Icon-only create button

**Danger**

The danger style should also be used sparingly to draw attention to actions that might be destructive, like delete.

> Example: Delete button left icon

**Disabled**

A button can be *enabled* or *disabled*. The disabled style is the same for all of the above-described styles.

> Example: Disabled Open in Nextcloud button with right icon, disabled Settings button with left icon, disabled More icon with right button

## Options

A button can optionally have:

- A left-icon
- A right-icon
- Text

These can be combined. The most common combinations are:

**Text-only**

> Example

A button does not require any icons if the text is sufficient context.

**Text with left icon**

> Example

The left icon provides additional context when necessary.

**Text with right icon**

> Example

The right icon is not used as much but is available. The most common use case is to have a down-pointing arrow to signal the presence of drop-down menu, a right-pointing arrow to signal forward movement (in a multi-step process) or an ‘external’ icon to indicate that the link opens in a separate tab.

**Text with both icons**

> Example

Using both left and right icons is less common, but can be useful in certain contexts, like when you need a left icon for context and a right icon to indicate a drop-down list.

**Icon-only**

> Example

Some buttons are so common in OpenProject that they do not necessarily need a text label. However, these icons need an alt-text for accessibility.

_Note: We discourage using icon-only buttons if the icon unfamiliar to the user, or the action is one that the user would not have previously encountered. The only exception is when space is very tight and there is immediate feedback (eg. “configure” button on a search bar)._

## States

**Regular**

>Example: Basic More with left icon, Main Save, Accent Create with left icon, Danger Delete with left icon

**Hover**

>Example: Basic More with left icon, Main Save, Accent Create with left icon, Danger Delete with left icon

**Clicked**

>Example: Basic More with left icon, Main Save, Accent Create with left icon, Danger Delete with left icon

## Truncation/Variable width

The labels on buttons should ideally be as short as possible. 

Nevertheless, there will be time when the width of a label will be longer than the available space. This can happen for a number of reasons:

- The label being longer in another language (“Add assignee” vs “Abtretungsempfänger hinzufügen”)
- Changes to the layout due to window resizing or a new pane that compresses previously wider space

There are two possible solutions, depending on the context:

**Truncate label within a fixed-width button**
If the button has to be fixed-width, and the text is too long, the button should wrap around to fit the entire label.

**Resize the button to fit the label**
If space allows, the button can have a max-width setting, so that it can first stretch vertically to allow the entire label to fit in one line, failing which, it should wrap to the next line.

## Margin and Spacing

The width of the button is generally set by the contents (notably by the length of the text and the presence of icons). In certain situations, the button might have a fixed length.
