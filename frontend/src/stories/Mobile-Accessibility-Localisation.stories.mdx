# Devices and Accessibility

## Desktop-first

OpenProject is not primarily designed for mobile use or with a mobile-first approach, despite most parts of the software adapting fairly well to smaller screens. The majority of features and views are designed to take advantage of larger screens and more complex interactions, including keyboard shortcuts.

Nevertheless,Â  certain features are particularly useful in a mobile context. These include accessing notifications on the go, viewing work packages, reading and responding to comments and viewing attachments and linked files. These features will be given particular attention and optimised for mobile use.

We do not consider project planning, complex scheduling and team planning to be priority use cases on mobile.

## Accessibility

We recognise the importance of accessibility and are aware that OpenProject still has a fair bit of progress to make in this regard. We intend to initially focus on improving contrast, ensuring UI elements have meaningful alt-text and descriptions and expanding the support for keyboard shortcuts.

We will incrementally evaluate ways to improve our design to better serve users with visual, auditory or motor impairment.

## Localisation and internationalisation

OpenProject supports several languages. Our designs must take internalisation into account, notably in terms of string length and spacing.

The primary design language is English. Our Figma prototypes are always designed first with strings in English and, when relevant, tested with German, French and Spanish translations. This covers our largest user base.

For other languages, we rely on our translators and our community on \[Crowdin\](https://crowdin.com/translate/openproject/) for their help. If there are design-specific issues that are present in certain languages, we encourage the community to file bug reports so we may fix them.
