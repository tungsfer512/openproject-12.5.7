# Modal Date Picker 

They currently only exist in one variant:

- *Single:* Currently used only when adding individual non-working days in the admin settings. The picker has an additional text field for the name of the non-working day.

> **Example**: Modal work package single date picker (Add non-working day)

It consists of:

- Options (optional)
    - This can be any selector field or form field required by the modal
- Input field (single date field)
- One mini calendar
- Action bar

The modal date picker does not have a range variant.

## Mobile

> **Example**: Mobile version of modal date picker

The **mobile** version is exactly the same except:

- The date picker, like all modals, is displayed full screen with a translucent grey background.
- The action bar has only action (*Save*); the cancel button is hidden, and is replaced with a close floating close button *outside* at the bottom (centred), as is common to all modals in mobile


## Margins and spacing

1 rem between horizontal groupsets

## Accessibility

The date picker receives focus when it is launched and traps focus until the user either closes the modal (via Enter or Escape). These fields can receive keyboard focus:

- Options
- Input fields
- Action bar

The mini-calendar itself does not afford keyboard navigation (see see [Date Picker: Common elements](#) for accessibility shortcomings of of Flatpickr).
