# Tooltip

> Example of a tooltip, configurable  (info tooltip, text: "This is the current project you are in.")

The tooltip provides additional textual context on hover over interactive elements. 

This context can be used to provide additional information (hover over a "help" icon) or to signal state information (for example, if a certain item is disabled).

By default, the tooltip takes 80% of the width of the container. This can be overridden if needed. 

> Eg. Tooltip on a file list, on a file that is not available due to permissions issues

## Structure and Options

Tooltips have a sky blue background in the default theme (_Feedback/Info/Light_). A darker version is available is but currently not used.

> Example of the darker one

export const Template = (args) => ({
  parameters: {
    component: SbTooltipComponent,
  },
  props: {
    disabled: args.disabled,
    dark: args.dark,
    alignment: args.alignment,
    body: args.body,
  },
})

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Default"
    args={{
      body: 'This is a tooltip',
      dark: false,
      disabled: false,
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>


## Behaviour

The tooltip should appear either above or below the item being hovered. By default, it will be displayed above, left-aligned. This can be manually changed to these alternative positions:

- Above, left-aligned
- Above, center-aligned
- Above, right-aligned
- Below, left-aligned
- Below, center-aligned
- Below, right- aligned

The item over which the user is hovering itself must never be covered. A tooltip' does not follow the cursor; its position is fixed as long as the user is hovering over the item. Hovering out of the element will cause the tooltip to disappear. 

The tooltip will appear 200 ms after the user starts hovering and disappear 200 ms after the user has moved the cursor away, to avoid jittery behaviour.

The tooltip will automatically become multi-line if necessary (i.e, if the container does not have sufficient space).

> Example: multi-line tooltip (so a very long one). Text: ""

## Dos and Don'ts

A tooltip is, in its basic form, a line of text. However, it can also contain icons. 

It must never contain interactive elements (a mouse pointer will not always be able to reach it).

## Margins and Spacing

A tooltip will never hug either side of the container; it will respect the internal padding of the that container.

> Position, in-tree or out-of-tree to be decided

Due to technical limitations, the minimum width of a tooltip is defined by its container (i.e, 80% of it).  Tooltips with content shorter this width will have additional space on the right.
