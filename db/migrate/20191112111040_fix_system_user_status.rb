    # used to be locked (3). An oversight on our part.
    #
    # We also update the anonymous user again. While it was correctly updated
    # in the previous migration, newly created anonymous users since have the
    # wrong status (0) because we failed to update the on-the-fly
    # creation of the anonymous user with the correct status.

    deleted_user.update_all status: Principal.statuses[:active]

    # There is no need to update the anonymous user since it was supposed to be
    # active at this point already anyway. The previous migration then makes it
    # built-in (0) again if we rollback even further.
