    By providing a `notificationMessage` within the `_meta` block of the payload, the client can include a customized message to the user
    of the updated membership. In case of a group, the message will be sent to every user belonging to the group.

    By including `{ "sendNotifications": false }` within the `_meta` block of the payload, no notifications is send out at all.
