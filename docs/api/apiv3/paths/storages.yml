    Creates a storage resource. When creating a storage, a confidential OAuth 2 provider application is created
    automatically. The oauth client id and secret of the created OAuth application are returned in the response.
    
    **IMPORTANT:** This is the only time, the oauth client secret is visible to the consumer. After that, the secret is
    hidden.
    
    To update the storage with OAuth client credentials, which enable the storage resource to behave as an OAuth 2
    client against an external OAuth 2 provider application, another request must be made to create those, see
    `POST /api/v3/storages/{id}/oauth_client_credentials`.
