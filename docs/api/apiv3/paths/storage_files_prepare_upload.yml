post:
  summary: Preparation of a direct upload of a file to the given storage.
  operationId: prepare_storage_file_upload
  tags:
    - File links
  description: |-
    Executes a request that prepares a link for a direct upload to the storage.
    
    The background here is, that the client needs to make a direct request to the storage instance for file uploading,
    but should not get access to the credentials, which are stored in the backend. The response contains a link object,
    that enables the client to execute a file upload without the real credentials.

    - name: id
