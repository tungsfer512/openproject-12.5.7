# OpenProject 5.0.6

OpenProject 5.0.6 contains several bug fixes:

  - It was not possible to duplicate work packages. This has been
    resolved
    ([#21666](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21666/activity)).
  - The wrong grouping sum was displayed when grouping by the
    responsible. This has been fixed
    ([#21859](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21859/activity)).
  - Load animations on the work package page have been added
    ([#22008](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22008/activity)).
  - Bulk actions on work packages across projects did not work
    correctly. This has been fixed
    ([#22164](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22164/activity)).
  - In some cases the work package creation did not work properly when
    creating a work package from the work package full screen
    ([#22244](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22244/activity)).
  - Several design fixes are included
    ([#21729](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21729/activity),
    [#21799](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21799/activity),
    [#22273](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22273/activity),
    [#22272](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22272/activity),
    [#22271](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22271/activity),
    [#22270](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22270/activity)).
  - The accessibility has been improved in several places.

OpenProject 5.0.6 also includes a new icon set
([#21603](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21603/activity)).

Changing a work packages assignee and responsible works significantly
faster in projects with a lot of members.
