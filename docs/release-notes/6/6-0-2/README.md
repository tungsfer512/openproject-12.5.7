# OpenProject 6.0.2

**The following errors have been fixed in OpenProject 6.0.2:**

  - An error message was displayed when all work package filters were
    removed
    ([#23739](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23739/activity)).
  - Multiple empty options were displayed in work package select fields
    ([#23775](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23775/activity)).
  - Adding images to the work package description sometimes didnâ€™t work
    ([#23750](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23750/activity)).
  - The text formatting toolbar was missing when editing news
    ([#23740](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23740/activity)).
  - Some groups were collapsed when grouping an already grouped list by
    another attribute
    ([#23720](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23720/activity)).
  - No warning message was shown when leaving a work package type with
    entered description
    ([#23746](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23746/activity)).
  - Checking / unchecking checkboxes of one row / column in the workflow
    edit screen not working
    ([#23694](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23694/activity)).
  - Several design errors have been fixed
    ([#23594](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23594/activity),
    [#23742](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23742/activity),
    [#23743](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23743/activity),
    [#23768](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23768/activity),
    [#23651](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23651/activity)).

Additionally, the performance on the work package table has been
improved: Scrolling and hovering of large work package lists works
faster than before.
