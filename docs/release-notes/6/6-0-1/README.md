# OpenProject 6.0.1

**OpenProject 6.0.1 contains the following changes for the Wiki module:**

In OpenProject versions prior to 6.0.0., specific characters of
[wiki](../../../user-guide/wiki/) titles were removed
upon saving – especially dots and spaces. Spaces were replaced with an
underscore, while other characters were removed.  
Still, linking to these pages was possible with either the original
title (e.g., ‘\[\[Title with spaces\]\]’), or the processed title (e.g.,
‘\[\[title\_with\_spaces\]\]’).  
Starting
with [OpenProject 6.0.0](https://www.openproject.org/blog/openproject-6-0-released/), titles
were allowed to contain arbitrary characters and were linked to using
escaped links.
([#20151](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/20151/activity)).  
That change caused those links with spaces to wiki pages to break after
the migration to OpenProject 6.0.0, since they now linked to a new page
(with actual spaces in its title, since that was allowed now).

This bug was fixed in
[#23674](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23674) alongside
a more permanent change to how wiki titles are produced. Titles may
still contain arbitrary characters now, but are processed into a
permalink (URL slug) upon saving.  
This causes the identifiers of wiki pages with non-ascii characters to
be more visually pleasing and easier to link to. When upgrading to
OpenProject 6.0.1., permalinks for all your pages will be generated
automatically.

**Additionally, the following errors have been fixed in OpenProject
6.0.1:**
