# OpenProject 6.0.3

OpenProject 6.0.3 contains an important security fix. It upgrades the
Rails version to 4.2.7.1 to address the following
CVEs:

[CVE-2016-6317](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ruby-security-ann/WccgKSKiPZA)  
[CVE-2016-6316](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ruby-security-ann/8B2iV2tPRSE)

**The following bugs have been fixed in OpenProject 6.0.3:**

  - The help and profile dropdown changed rapidly when hovering over
    them ([#23745](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23745/activity)).
  - Safari did not display the pagination buttons on the work package
    page
    ([#23785](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23785/activity)).
  - The projects-menu did not properly display all projects in some
    cases
    ([#23774](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23774/activity)).
  - Several design errors have been fixes
    ([#23778](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23778/activity),
    [#23801](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23801/activity)).
  - Additionally, the performance on the work package page has been
    slightly improved
    ([#23781](https://community.openproject.com/work_packages/23781/activity)).

We strongly recommend the upgrade.
